# Arctium - .NET Core Crypto Library
Arctium is a simple crypto library, created and maintained for learning purpose. 
It provides various cryptographic functions, ciphers, connection protocols etc. implemented for better or worse but probably they should works.

## Projects
Solution is partitioned into  a following projects, each of them is a set of related algorithms. If you wish to get more informations about specific project, algorithm and examples, see appropriate [docs] folder. Each folder contains more specific informations and examples.

### ArctiumCLI 
In the future there may be some console interface utility tool
